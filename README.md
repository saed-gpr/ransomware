# :space_invader: about tool
Ransomware can lock the target's programs until the target pays the hacker.
this is a very simple ransommware that you can open the "ransomware.py" file and improve it, or you can Fork it!!
and in the future, I plan to update this tool. so please support me :)

# how to use it :interrobang:

- download the "ransomware.py" file.
- open it with vscod. in line 20, clear the "write here your file type" and then write the type of files that you want to lock it
- it is now ready to use :wink:
